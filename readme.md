Features
--------

### Vector Rendering
Rendering OpenStreetMap-data using MapCSS or a custom style interpreter. Using a vector format for mobile devices rendering offline map data on Android/iOS is also possible.

### Routing
Routing also using OpenStreetMap-data. Custom routing profiles are possible and offline routing on mobile devices can be done using a pre-processed binary format.

### Map View/Controls
For Android/iOS there are views available that can be used to show offline vector data but also regular OpenStreetMap tiles or GPX or KML data.

### Optimisation Code
OsmSharp started as a project for logistical optimisation. There are several solvers for the (A)TSP and some VRP's.

### Data Processing
OpenStreetMap data can be hard to handle sometimes. Basic filtering, conversion and database providers exists to import/export OpenStreetMap data.
